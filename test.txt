Always when a repeat movie is made there is critique about about the remake not reflecting the original accurately. Now, when the Lion King movie resembles the original in almost mirror like fashion, there is critique about the modern version not having enough originality. All I could ever have asked for is my favourite childhood movie of all time remade with such technical perfection and gorgeous CGI. Sure, the animals are photorealistic, but the visuals are stunning and it is no doubt an unforgettable journey through Africa. It is by no means THE original movie, but there is plenty to appreciate here.
Hakuna Matata. What a wonderful phrase. Hakuna Matata. Ain't no passing phrase. The Lion King (2019) is the #1 Movie in the World. It brings a whole joy of magic of Disney and wonders, all over again. The Lion King is one of the best instant classic Disney remakes of another generation to remember the King of Pride Rock. It's a very beautiful live-action film, like the original. They did the exact same lines and scenes from the original, but in a different way of making something new out of it. And it can make you laugh, cry, and feel the love for this movie to have fun and enjoy for the whole family.
Ask yourself honestly - Why does this exist? Was there some artistic vision that was not expressed in the original that warranted a remake? Is the animation of the original sub-par and outdated? Was Jeremy Irons underwhelming as the voice of Scar? How does this new adaptation build and/or improve upon the original? What made the original so timeless and magical was not the story, it was the one thing they changed - the animation. This "Live Action" (which is not in fact live action since it's 100% CG) does make the animals look realistic, which essentially means they look bored, emotionless, and overall bland, while supposedly going through very human range emotions that real animals just can't convey. And the cherry on top is that while the original animation is timeless, this new CGI will look about as dated in 10 years as the Star Wars prequels look now. This is a tasteless, visionless cash grab. Nothing more.
Well...the visual effects are groundbreaking but it lacks heart and flare - and feels soulless compared to the original. Donald Glover and Beyonc√© felt like miscasts - it feels like they're reading lines from a sheet. See this remake for the visual effects; but go back and watch the original animated masterpiece in all its glory.
